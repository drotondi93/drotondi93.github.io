# gradient-background-generator
This was a fun project I worked on form Udemy's Zero to Mastery 2020 Web Development course.
Open index.html in your broswer.
Use the color pickers to change the gradient background through javascript and CSS.
The CSS property and color code is displayed for your use on your next website!
